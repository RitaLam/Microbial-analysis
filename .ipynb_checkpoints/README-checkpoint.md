___

This is the goal of this analysis aim to investigate he effect of indoor daylight on temporal and spatial differences of indoor microbiome and indoor pathogens in a hospital setting.
Microbial analysis consists of 3 parts which can be found in folder "script":

* **PART 1**: Total bacterial abundance analysis
* **PART 2**  QIIME2 Sequencing data processing, Beta diversity analysis in R
* **PART 3**  Alhpha diversity, EKSPAE pathogen relative abundance analysis

NOTE: All raw data can be found in folder "Raw data"
* qPCR_Data is used for PART 1 total bacteria abudnance
* "QIIME 2" include all the files used for analysis in Part 2 
* The "shannon_index.csv", "Staphylococcus_abundance.csv", "Pseudomonas_abundance.csv" were used for analysis in Part 3. These file are generated in R from Part 2
